# Voltage-Controlled-Switch
The Voltage Controlled Switch is a project designed for Electronic Devices and Circuits I at McMaster University. (Grade: A+)

The project implements a full wave bridge rectifier using diodes with a capacitor filter to convert a 120 V AC input simulated with a function generator to a stable 3 V Â± 0.1 V DC supply with a 10-mA current output at 1 kHz. The design successfully delivers reliable DC power supply upon verifying with tools such as PSpice simulations, Analog Discovery 2, Waveforms, and physical circuit measurement analysis.
