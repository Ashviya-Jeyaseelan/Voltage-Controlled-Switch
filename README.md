# Voltage-Controlled-Switch
The Voltage Controlled Switch is a project designed for Electronic Devices and Circuits I at McMaster University.

The project implements two types of switches with MOSFETs based on the given constraints. The design assesses the non-idealities of both switches by using quantitative methods to measure and calculate inadequacies with tools such as PSpice simulations, Analog Discovery 2, Waveforms, and physical circuit analysis.
